# eTicketing_App_Vue
Creating an e-ticketing application using Vue. Lecture from Codecademy

## Notes 
- On JavaScript file 
    - Data section is used to store known dynamic data
    - Computed is used to store dynamic data that is computed using other pieces of dynamic data. A computed value will only recompute when a dynamic value used inside of its getter function changes. 
    - Computed values can be broken to getter values and setter values. Getter functions are when we use data values provided to perform new calculations
    - Setter functions are when we set the values of the data to the newly derived values from the calculations in getter function
